  <h2>🔥 ABOUT PROJECT</h2>
  <p>
    Inspired by the animated film <em>How to Train Your Dragon</em>, our team developed an autonomous robot dragon designed for interactive storytelling. This innovative system combines artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and animatronic engineering to create a narrative experience that explores themes of empathy, trust, and cross-cultural communication.
  </p>

  <h3>🎯 Project Goals</h3>
  <p>
    The main objective was to build a robot capable of engaging in emotionally intelligent performances, demonstrating diagnostic thinking, and interacting with a human character in real time. We aimed to show how robotics can communicate complex ideas through accessible technology and expressive design.
  </p>

  <h3>🧠 Artificial Intelligence</h3>
  <p>
    The system integrates three distinct AI modules:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dialogue AI</strong> – handles natural language interaction</li>
      <li><strong>Analytical AI</strong> – performs diagnostic reasoning</li>
      <li><strong>Object Recognition AI</strong> – identifies and tracks boundaries of physical objects</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>🛠️ Technical Features</h3>
  <p>
    The main robot is powered by a Raspberry Pi and utilizes AI-based speech processing, object detection, and an augmented reality display. A diagnostic algorithm simulates a medical examination scenario, while the AR component provides an “X-ray” visualization of the dragon’s internal state in response to user input.
  </p>

  <h3>🐉 Animatronic Design</h3>
  <p>
    The robot features independently controlled motors for facial expressions, wing movements, and coordinated body gestures. These elements enhance emotional realism and allow the dragon to respond expressively to the storyline.
  </p>

  <h3>🤖 Autonomous Behavior</h3>
  <p>
    The robot operates autonomously using pre-programmed behavior trees and condition-based logic. It can respond to voice commands, navigate around obstacles, and provide non-verbal feedback in sync with the narrative.
  </p>

  <h3>🌍 Impact and Applications</h3>
  <p>
    This project demonstrates how low-cost modular technologies can be used to create emotionally expressive robots for education, entertainment, and cultural outreach. It pushes the boundaries of narrative-driven robotics and promotes values of compassion and collaboration through technology.
